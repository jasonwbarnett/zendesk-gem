# Zendesk

Yet Another Zendesk API wrapper in Ruby. I wrote this because none of the current API wrappers
could do what I needed. I attempted to look at the others to see if I could improve them and
submit merge/pull requests but they were extremely complex and I wasted a lot of time.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'zendesk'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install zendesk
